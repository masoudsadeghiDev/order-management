# **E-Commerce Order Management System**  

## **Project Overview**  
The **E-Commerce Order Management System** is a **Java-based** application designed to manage product inventory, customer orders, and payments efficiently. Built using **Hexagonal Architecture**, it ensures a clean separation between business logic and infrastructure, making the system **scalable, maintainable, and testable**.  

## **Project Structure (Hexagonal Architecture)**  
The project follows **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)** to separate core business logic from external dependencies like databases, APIs, and messaging systems.  

```
ecommerce-order-system/
│── application/       # Business logic (use cases)
│── domain/            # Entities, Aggregates, and Value Objects
│── infrastructure/    # Hibernate, Database, Adapters (REST, Messaging)
│── configuration/     # Spring Boot Configurations
│── main/              # Main Application
```

## **Tech Stack**  
The system is built using modern Java technologies for reliability and scalability.  

- **Java (Spring Boot)** – For building RESTful APIs.  
- **Hibernate (JPA)** – For Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).  
- **PostgreSQL** – As the primary relational database.  
- **Lombok** – To reduce boilerplate code.  
- **Docker** – For containerization and easy deployment.  

## **Key Features**  
✅ **User Management** – Register, login, and manage roles (Admin, Customer, Seller).  
✅ **Product Management** – Add, update, and delete products.  
✅ **Inventory Tracking** – Monitor stock levels in real time.  
✅ **Order Management** – Create, update, and cancel orders with multiple statuses.  
✅ **Payment Integration** – Support for payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal.  
✅ **Scalability** – Follows **Hexagonal Architecture** for modular expansion.
